//! Common utilities shared across multiple days
//!
//! This module contains helper functions, data structures, and algorithms
//! that are used by multiple day solutions. Common patterns include:
//!
//! - Grid/2D array utilities
//! - Parsing helpers
//! - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
//! - Number theory utilities (GCD, LCM, primes, etc.)
//! - String manipulation helpers
//!
//! ## Guidelines for Adding Common Code
//!
//! - Add code here when it's used by 2+ days
//! - Keep implementations generic and well-documented
//! - Prefer small, focused utilities over large frameworks
//! - Add examples in doc comments
//! - Consider performance implications
//!
//! ## Module Organization
//!
//! As common code grows, organize into submodules:
//! ```ignore
//! pub mod grid;    // 2D grid utilities
//! pub mod parse;   // Parsing helpers
//! pub mod graph;   // Graph algorithms
//! pub mod math;    // Number theory
//! ```

// Modules will be added here as common patterns emerge during daily implementations
// Example:
// pub mod grid;
// pub mod parse;
