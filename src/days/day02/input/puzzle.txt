--- Day 2: Gift Shop ---

You get inside and take the elevator to its only other stop: the gift shop. One of the clerks asks for your help identifying invalid product IDs that a young Elf accidentally added to the database.

Part 1: An ID is invalid if it's made only of some sequence of digits repeated exactly twice (e.g., 55, 6464, 123123).

Part 2: An ID is invalid if it's made only of some sequence of digits repeated at least twice (e.g., 12341234, 123123123, 1212121212, 1111111).

Given ranges of product IDs, find and sum all invalid IDs in those ranges.
