# Day 4: [Puzzle Title]

## Problem Statement

[Provide a concise 2-3 sentence summary of the puzzle. Focus on what needs to be solved, not implementation details.]

### Example Input
```
[Paste example input from puzzle description]
```

### Example Output
- Part 1: `[expected output]`
- Part 2: `[expected output]`

## Algorithm & Approach

### Part 1

[Explain the approach used to solve Part 1. Include:]
- What data structures were chosen and why
- The high-level algorithm or strategy
- Any key insights that make the solution work
- Trade-offs considered

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(?)
- Space: O(?)

[Justify these complexities briefly]

### Part 2

[Explain how Part 2 differs from Part 1. Include:]
- What changed in the problem
- Whether the Part 1 solution could be reused or adapted
- What new challenges emerged
- The final approach

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(?)
- Space: O(?)

## Implementation Notes

- Notable Rust patterns or idioms used
- Performance optimizations applied
- Edge cases handled
- Challenges encountered and how they were solved
- Interesting language features leveraged

[Keep this section focused on educational value - what would help someone learn from this code?]

## Benchmark Results

[Include this section only if multiple approaches were tested]

| Approach | Part 1 Time | Part 2 Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Approach A | X ms | Y ms | [Brief description] |
| Approach B | X ms | Y ms | [Brief description] |

**Winner:** [Which approach and why]

[Provide context about the benchmarks:]
- Input characteristics that influenced performance
- Why one approach outperformed others
- When you might choose the slower approach (if ever)

## Alternative Approaches Considered

[Briefly discuss other approaches considered but not implemented, or implemented and benchmarked out:]

1. **[Approach name]**: [Why it wasn't chosen or why it lost the benchmark]
2. **[Approach name]**: [Trade-offs that made it less suitable]

[This section helps readers understand the decision-making process and learn about algorithm trade-offs]
